# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a machine learning model. Various factor such as cholesterol, glucose chol/hdl_ratio, age, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure are considrered in the prediction

Data
The dataser udes for this project includes information on cholesterol, glucose, hdl_chol, chol/hdl_ratio, age, gende, height, weight, bmi, systolic_bp, diastolic_bp, waist, hip, waist/hip_ratioand diabetes. Additional preprocessing details can be found in the code.
This data was provided by the Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine.
The data consist of 19 variables on 403 subjects from 1046 subjects who were interviewed in a study to understand the prevalence of obesity, diabetes. The 403 subjects were the ones who were actually screened for diabetes.


Model Training
The model is trained using a Logistic Regression Model and KNeighbors Model, considering the selected features. To improve de model some columns in the data were not used.
The dataset is preprocessed, and techniques such as SMOTE are applied to handle imbalanced data. The Undersampling and Oversampling were were also used to see if there was any difference

Evaluation
Model evaluation includes key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The model's performance is assessed based on these metrics. Additionally, a confusion matrix provides insights into the true positives, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

Results
The project results showcase the effectiveness of the model in predicting diabetes. The best model was the Logistic Regression Model with the recall of 1.
Looking at the graphs we do not see a clear relationship between the factors used and diabetes. It would be nice to work with a similar database but with more data, to see if we could observe any strong relationship between these factors and diabetes.
